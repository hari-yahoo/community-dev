Q&A
2. Assessment Scope
2.1. Objective of the Assessment
Briefly explain the objectives of the 8-week assessment:
Understanding and documenting the current architecture (database, APIs, data flow).
Identifying areas for optimization and streamlining.
Preparing for future scalability and performance improvements.
2.2. Phases of the Assessment
Database Schema Assessment (3 weeks)
Data Flow Assessment (3 weeks)
API Assessment (2 weeks)
3. Key Findings
3.1. High-Level Summary
Provide a brief summary of the overall findings across the database, APIs, and data flow.
Mention key areas that require immediate attention (e.g., performance bottlenecks, redundancies, security risks).
4. Database Schema Assessment (3 Weeks)
4.1. Database Overview

Brief overview of the databases assessed (e.g., number of databases, tables, and schemas involved).
Mention key areas such as normalization, table relationships, and data integrity.
4.2. Findings

Schema Design: Identify issues related to naming conventions, redundant data, lack of normalization, etc.
Indexes: Highlight areas where indexing is missing or could be optimized.
Redundancies: Mention any redundant tables or columns identified.
Relationships: Analyze the foreign key relationships and any potential anomalies.
4.3. Recommendations

Suggestions for improving schema design, normalization, and reducing redundancies.
Adding or optimizing indexes to enhance query performance.
Improving naming conventions and documentation.
Better enforcement of foreign key relationships for data integrity.
5. Data Flow Assessment (3 Weeks)
5.1. Overview of the Data Flow

Describe the overall data flow between systems, databases, and applications.
Mention key processes where data flows are critical.
5.2. Findings

Bottlenecks: Identify any bottlenecks in the data flow.
Data Latency: Mention areas where data synchronization or transfer is slow.
Security: Highlight any security issues related to data flow (e.g., unsecured data transfers).
5.3. Recommendations

Suggestions to streamline data flow and remove bottlenecks.
Improvements in data transfer mechanisms (e.g., using asynchronous processing, optimizing ETL jobs).
Enhancing data security with encryption and access controls during transfer.
6. API Assessment (2 Weeks)
6.1. Overview of the API Environment

Briefly describe the APIs assessed, their purpose, and interaction with the system.
Mention any key dependencies on external or internal systems.
6.2. Findings

Performance: Highlight API performance issues such as long response times or high failure rates.
Documentation: Mention any gaps in API documentation, versioning, or standardization.
Security: Identify any security vulnerabilities in API authentication or data handling.
6.3. Recommendations

Performance Optimization: Suggestions for improving API performance (e.g., caching, optimizing endpoints).
Security Enhancements: Implementing stronger authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and securing data transmission.
Documentation and Standardization: Recommendations for improving API documentation, versioning, and adhering to best practices like RESTful standards.
7. Recommendations and Action Plan
7.1. High-Priority Actions

List of the highest priority actions (short-term fixes) to be taken based on the assessment.
7.2. Long-Term Improvements

Recommendations for long-term improvements in the database structure, data flow optimization, and API enhancements.
7.3. Future Roadmap

A roadmap with timelines for implementing these improvements.
Assign responsibilities to teams for each of the key recommendations.
